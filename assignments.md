# Group Assignments

To successfully complete a group assignment, you will usually need to pick a task, complete the task, open a pull request with the complete task, and have your task reviewed and merged by a teammate. You will also need to review a pull request. 

## Assignment Tracking

Because group assignments involve many pieces, you will keep track of your group work on an assignment tracking repo. 
You will update the document in your personal assignment tracking repo every day to give information on your group assignment task and link to your pull request and 
review.

## Group Blogs

Your team will keep a blog summarizing what you learn during the bootcamp. Each person should write a total of four blog posts.
The first is an interview of someone on your team. After that, you should rotate team members to update the blog with summaries of the material
for each day, with each person writing three blog posts. If you are on a team with two people, each person should still write three posts, but you 
will not have an entry for every day.

You will be put into groups to complete your software project. When you first meet, you should come up with a name for your team. 

When you get in your groups, you can start your blog:

Make sure that everyone in the group uses **exactly** the same team name. The link will create a shared repository for you which you should do pull requests against.
You will only need to click the link once to make the assignment.
