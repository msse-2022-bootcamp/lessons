You will have group assignments and individual assignments for this course. Group assignmens are completed with your group in the second half of the day after lecture.


# Group Assignments

To successfully complete a group assignment, you will usually need to pick a task, complete the task, open a pull request with the complete task, and have your task reviewed and merged by a teammate. You will also need to review a pull request. 

## Assignment Tracking

Because group assignments involve many pieces, you will keep track of your group work on an assignment tracking repo. 
You will update the document in your personal assignment tracking repo every day to give information on your group assignment task and link to your pull request and 
review.
