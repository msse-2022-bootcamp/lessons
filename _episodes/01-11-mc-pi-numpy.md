# Rewriting our calculation of pi using NumPy

We will now return to our calculation of $$\pi$$. Instead of using the Python Standard Library functions, we will examine how this calculation could have been made much simpler using the NumPy library.

Recall our former code for calculating $$\pi$$
~~~
n_samples = 100

num_inside = 0

for i in range(n_samples):

    # Generate a random point between 0 and 1 for x.
    x = random.random()

    # Generate a random point between 0 and 1 for y.
    y = random.random()

    # Calculate the radius of this point
    r = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)

    if r < 1:
        num_inside += 1

pi = 4 * (num_inside) / n_samples
~~~
{: .language-python}

To start using numpy, we will first import it.

~~~
import numpy as np
~~~
{: .language-python}

We set the same number of samples:

~~~
n_samples = 100
~~~
{: .language-python}

Next, we generate 100 random points. In our previous code, we did this using the `random.random` function in a `for` loop.

NumPy also has a `random.random` function. You can try it out:

~~~
np.random.random()
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
0.627385792598836
~~~
{: .output}

When no argument is given to `np.random.random` it behaves exactly as we are used to `random.random`. It gives us one random number. However, you can also give the function a size to generate an array of random numbers. 

For us, we would like a random array that is size `n_samples, 2`. 

~~~
random_numbers = np.random.random((n_samples, 2))
~~~
{: .language-python}

If you check this variable, you will see it is an array with 100 rows and 2 columns.

The next thing we need to do is to square and sum the x and y values. We can square all the values at once because of element-wise operations:

~~~
r_squared = random_numbers ** 2
~~~
{: .language-python}

Next, we want to sum all of the rows of r_squared. We will want to use the numpy function `sum` which we learned about in the last module.

Executing 

~~~
np.sum(r_squared)
~~~
{: .language-python}

will give us the value of the sum of all the elements. We want a sum of the rows, so we will want to use the `axis` arugment.

To figure out the axis we want, check the shape of `r_squared`

~~~
r_squared.shape
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
(100, 2)
~~~
{: .output}

If we want the sum of the rows, we should use `axis=1 `. We expect that this sum should have 100 values, so check this after your calculation:

~~~
vals = np.sum(r_squared, axis=1)
vals.shape
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
(100, )
~~~
{: .output}

Next, we can easily count the number of points inside the circle using logical comparison with the numpy array.

~~~
points_inside = vals < 1
num_inside = np.sum(points_inside)
~~~
{: .language-python}

Finally, we estimate $$\pi$$

~~~
pi = 4 * num_inside / n_samples
~~~
{: .language-python}


Final code:
~~~
import math
import numpy as np

# Start by using 100 samples.
n_samples = 100

random_numbers = np.random.random(size=(n_samples,2))

vals = np.sum(random_numbers**2, axis=1)
vals = np.sqrt(vals)
num_inside = np.sum(vals < 1)

pi = 4 * num_inside / n_samples
~~~
{: .language-python}

## Comparing Performace : NumPy vs Python Standard Library

Let's try timing how long it takes to calculate $$\pi$$ with 10 million samples for each method:

~~~
import time
import random

start = time.time()
# Start by using 100 samples.
n_samples = 1000000

num_inside = 0
for i in range(n_samples):
    # Generate a random point between 0 and 1 for x.
    x = random.random()
    
    # Generate a random point between 0 and 1 for y.
    y = random.random()
    
    ## Calculate the radius of this point.
    r = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)
    
    # if this value is less than 1, the point is inside the circle.
    if r < 1:
        num_inside += 1
4 * num_inside / n_samples

end = time.time()

elapsed_time = end - start
print(elapsed_time)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
0.6184561252593994
~~~
{: .output}

Do the same thing with the method which uses NumPy:

~~~
import time

start = time.time()
n_samples = 10000000

random_numbers = np.random.random(size=(n_samples,2))

vals = np.sum(random_numbers**2, axis=1)
num_inside = np.sum(vals < 1)
pi = 4 * num_inside / n_samples

end = time.time()

elapsed_time = end - start
print(elapsed_time)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
0.059281349182128906
~~~
{: .output}

We can see that our NumPy version is about 10 times faster than the one written in pure Python. This is a huge advantage to using NumPy - it can make your Python code much faster.

In our case, we were only waiting 5 seconds for our first calculation, so the pure Python version may not bother us that much. However, there are some cases (such as our MC simulation) which become very slow using pure Python for large systems.

For your homework, your task (it's a bonus), is to rewrite your MC simulation to use NumPy and to test the speed up.
