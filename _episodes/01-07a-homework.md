## Individual Homework Assignment
This should be completed by each group member individually. **Individual assignments are due one week after being assigned**. The due date for this assignment is **August 17, 2021**.

Write a python script that estimates the value of $$\pi$$ by evaluating the following integral using Monte Carlo integration:

$$ \int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{1 + x^2} dx $$

This integral will evaluate to $$\frac{\pi}{4} $$
