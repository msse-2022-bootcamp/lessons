## Discussion questions

1. What kinds of projects are best suited for C++? What about Python?

1. Can you think of a use case for mixing both languages (that is, a single project
that somehow uses both C++ and Python)? What would each language do in such a project?

1. We have now seen the Monte-Carlo method and the Riemann Sum method for
approximating integrals. You will notice that the number of integration points
for the Riemann Sum method is much less than the Monte-Carlo method. Why
would you ever use the Monte-Carlo method?
